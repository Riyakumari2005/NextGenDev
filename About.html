                    <h1>About me</h1>
                    <p>Hello! I am a first-year B.Tech student specializing in Information Technology. My journey into
                        the world of technology is just beginning, and I am excited to explore the endless possibilities
                        that IT offers. From coding my first lines of code to learning about the complex systems that
                        power our digital world, I am driven by curiosity and a passion for innovation.
                    </p>

                    <p> I am currently building a strong foundation in programming, algorithms, and network security,
                        with plans to dive deeper into areas like AI, machine learning, and web development. My academic
                        journey has also sparked an interest in developing projects that combine creativity with
                        technical skills to solve real-world problems.
                    </p>

                    <p>Outside of my studies, I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge through
                        online courses, coding challenges, and collaborative projects. My goal is to become proficient
                        in the latest technologies and eventually contribute to impactful tech solutions that can make a
                        difference.
                    </p>
